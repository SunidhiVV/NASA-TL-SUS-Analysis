# NASA-TL-SUS-Analysis
## Analysis of System Usability Scale vs. NASA Task Load Index

### Objective: 
Investigated the relationship between System Usability Scale (SUS) and Raw NASA Task Load Index (RTLX).

### Data Cleaning: 
Managed discrepancies in data values; removed outlier values from SUS to ensure data quality.

### Results: 
Found a significant positive correlation between SUS and RTLX [r(96) = 0.68, p<0.001], supporting the hypothesis of their interconnectedness.

### Discussion: 
Built upon existing research regarding usability and mental workload of users, emphasizing the correlation between the two. Reviewed various studies, highlighting differing viewpoints on the topic.

### Limitations & Future Research: Identified potential biases in the study and recognized the need for causal inferences. Discussed the evolution of tools like RTLX and prospects of improved versions like Hybrid-SUS.

### Conclusion: 
Confirmed a positive correlation between usability (as measured by SUS) and the mental workload experienced by users (as indicated by RTLX).
